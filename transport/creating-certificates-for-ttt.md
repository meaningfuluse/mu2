Using the VMWare Image to Create Certificates for Transport Testing Tool (TTT)
==============================================================================

Last updated: March 8th, 2013 by Alan Viars

The goal of this document is to demonstrate how to create direct certificates
for use with NIST's Transport Testing Tool (TTT). If you have a "headless" server
you will need to use X11 or another tool build the certificates.  You can also
use NIST's "canned" version of certGen as described here. This is provided as a
convenience to make the process of generating direct certificates easier. It is
tool is packaged as a VMWare image and can be ran using VMWarePlayer and
other VMWare tools.


However you choose to get certGen up and running, you can use these instructions
as a guide to creating the certificates necessary to configure TTT.


Running the Canned version of CertGen using VMWare
--------------------------------------------------

1. Download the file [http://certgen.s3.amazonaws.com/certGen-Ubuntu-12-LTS-64bit.zip]
(http://certgen.s3.amazonaws.com/certGen-Ubuntu-12-LTS-64bit.zip)
1. Unzip the file "certGen-Ubuntu-12-LTS-64bit.zip" to a folder such as "certgen-vm".  For MacOSX users you will need to install MacPorts and install p7zip else you will get the error, "skipping: vmware/Direct-certGen-Ubuntu12-LTS-64-bit/Direct certGen - Ubuntu 64-bit.vmdk  need PK compat. v4.5 (can do v2.1)".  See http://www.ifusio.com/blog/unzip-issue-on-osx-need-pk-compat-v4-5-can-do-v2-1 for instuctions.
2. Download VMWare Player from [http://www.vmware.com/products/player/]
(http://www.vmware.com/products/player/)
3. Start VMWare Player.
4. Press Ctrl-O to open a VMWare Image
5. Navigate to folder extracted in step 1 and select the file
"Direct certGen - Ubuntu64-bit.vmx" and click "Open".
6. When the virtual VM is completely booted you will see a Desktop.
There is no password or login required, but the user and password are:
ubuntu/adm1nD1r3ct
7. Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open up a terminal window.
8. Start the certGen tool.

Type this into the terminal:

    cd direct/tools
    ./certGen.sh


You will need to create:

*Good Certificates-*

   1. a Trust Anchor, we will name "root". You will need the file "roo.der".
   2. A domain-bound certificates, buit from the aformentioned "root.", for
   "ttt.your-domain.com". You will need the files "ttt.your-domain.com.p12" and
   "ttt.your-domain.com.der".

*Negative Certificates-*

   1. An expired certificate.
   2. An invalid certificate whereby the email subject name is bogus.
   3. An invalid trurst relationship. We will call this
   "invalid-trust-relationship"  in these instructions. This anchor is valid,
   but if you use it in conjunction with "ttt.your-domain.com" from #2, in Good
   Certificates then it would be invalis because the domain-bound certifcate was
   not created with this trust anchor.

Details for creating a each type of certificate is detailed  in the following
sections.


Create a Root CA / Trust Anchor
-------------------------------

1. Enter the appropriate values for the CA you are creating in the certGen tool
following the example shown in the figure below. You only need to create one CA.


    CN:                             [Name for your CA - ex. "Root for your-domain.com"]
    Country:                        [Your Country] # Use two letter ISO code, e.g. US.
    State:                          [Your State]
    Location:                       [Your City]
    Org:                            [Your Organization Name]
    Email:                          [Email for Root CA - ex. root@ttt.your-domain.com]
    Expiration Days:                365
    Key Strength:                   1024
    Password:                       [Your password]
    Add Email to Alt Subject Names: Checked

2. Click the Create button to create the CA. This will create the files
"root.der" and "rootKey.der" in the /home/ubuntu/direct/tools directory.
If you need to create more leaf certificates from this CA later, You will need
these two files along with your password to reload the CA.



Create a Domain Bound Certificate
---------------------------------

1. After the CA is created (or loaded), click "Create Leaf Cert" button. Enter
the required values. Be sure to click the “Add Email to Alt Subject Names”.
DO NOT add a password. 

    CN:                                 [ttt.your-domain.com]
    Country:                            [Your Country] # Use two letter ISO code, e.g. US.
    State:                              [Your State]
    Location:                           [Your City]
    Org:                                [Your Organization Name]
    Email:                              [ttt.your-domain.com] #Notice this is not actually an email.
    Expiration Days:                    365
    Key Strength:                       1024
    Password:                           LEAVE BLANK
    Add Email to Alt Subject Names:     Checked

2. Click the "Create" button.This will create the files "direct.example.com.der",
"direct.example.com.p12", and "direct.example.comKey.der" in the
/home/ubuntu/direct/tools/ directory.


Neagative 1: Expired
--------------------


 1. An expired certificate.
   2. An invalid certificate whereby the email subject name is bogus.

    CN:                             [Name for your CA - ex. "Invalid trust relationship for your-domain.com"]
    Country:                        [Your Country] # Use two letter ISO code, e.g. US.
    State:                          [Your State]
    Location:                       [Your City]

    Password:                       [Your password]
    Add Email to Alt Subject Names: Checked

Negative 2: Invalid
-------------------

This is invalid certificate whereby the email subject name is bogus.

    CN:                             [Name for your CA - ex. "Invalid trust relationship for your-domain.com"]

    Add Email to Alt Subject Names: Checked

Negative 3: Create Another Root CA / Trust Anchor to be Used in the Invalid Trust Relationship Test
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Close the leaft node dialoge if certGen.sh, and the restart it.

2. Enter the appropriate values for the CA you are creating in the certGen tool
following the example shown in the figure below. You only need to create one CA.


    CN:                             [Name for your CA - ex. "Invalid trust relationship for your-domain.com"]
    Country:                        [Your Country] # Use two letter ISO code, e.g. US.
    State:                          [Your State]
    Location:                       [Your City]

"Create a Root CA")


3. Click the Create button to create the CA. This will create the files
"root.der" and "rootKey.der" in the /home/ubuntu/direct/tools directory.
If you need to create more leaf certificates from this CA later, You will need
these two files along with your password to reload the CA.
